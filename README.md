Just another repository
Hello, I'm freshman to BUPT this year(2021/9).
I'm glad I can start my new chapter and learn what I beloved.
In addition, I'm interested in sprints. To prove this, I won gold medals with my teammates and broke the U17 record of Shanghai. Also, I'm second level sportsman in 100m 200m and 400m.
